                                <p>One thing to remember is the genuine chance that the solar market will be
                                    shaken because of the Net Energy Metering vote set to take place on the 15th
                                    of December. If you want to learn more about the difference between the
                                    present agreement, NEM 2.0, and the proposed upgrade, NEM 3.0, take the time
                                    to read our analysis of the upcoming decision. The most crucial thing to
                                    remember is this - regardless of the agreement, we begin the new year solar,
                                    it will continue to be a reliable, secure investment that yields meaningful
                                    returns. NEM is only one element of the solar investment value proposition.
                                    Still, even without the Net Energy Metering agreement, solar is as appealing
                                    in the present as it has ever been.

                                <p>We don't advise wrapping and stowing the solar panel under the tree this
                                    year. Still, there's never been an ideal time to get an expert team of solar
                                    installers on the Roof to install your panels. Suppose you install solar
                                    panels on your home when the project is in operation. In that case, your
                                    property's value is likely to rise. The typical worth of your house will
                                    rise between $4000 and $6000 for each kW of solar energy installed. This
                                    means that bigger systems will bring more value! But, given the <b>price of
                                        solar energy</b>, the increase in property value alone can be a
                                    significant
                                    return on investment.
                                </p>
                                <p>In the end, your local housing market will be the primary determinant of how
                                    much the value of a solar system; however, all indications indicate solar
                                    panels provide thousands of dollars worth of worth to the home right from
                                    the moment it's put in. If that were all solar could offer, you'd still
                                    consider adding a solar system to your house. However, the benefits of solar
                                    keep offering from that point on!</p>
