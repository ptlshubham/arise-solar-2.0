							<h2 class="title text-primary"><b>Utility Rebate/Grant Management</b></h2>
							<p style="text-align: justify;">Although the price of solar panels has decreased
								substantially over the past decade, it's still a significant investment for
								businesses and home homeowners looking to reduce their electricity costs. To
								encourage increased use of solar governments across the country, the state
								and
								local government, and some utilities also offer incentives that make
								installing
								solar panels on your roof as well as making your home energy efficient by
								renewable power more cost-effective and affordable. These savings in energy
								typically come in the form of rebates for solar as well as tax incentives or
								incentives based on performance and could reduce the price of solar power by
								up
								to 50 percent!

								Grants are funds that are used to encourage renewable energy sources that do
								not
								require payment back. These groups are those with low incomes, farmers,
								rural
								homeowners, Native American tribes, schools, and non-profit groups.
							</p>
							<p style="text-align: justify;">Utilizing solar energy - despite offering many
								long-term benefits, can be a costly undertaking. This guide will aid
								homeowners
								in the present and the future to learn about Federal financing options that
								are
								available to them. It is important to note that the U.S. government is
								committed
								to renewable energy initiatives and for good reason. A few of the ways that
								it
								invests to benefit the United States as a whole are:
							</p>
							<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
								<li>Removing the use of fossil fuels that are finite and assisting the
									nation to
									be energy independent
								</li>
								<li>Enhancing the environmental quality by cutting CO2 emissions</li>
								<li>harnessing the unlimited quality of sunlight energy</li>
								<li>The creation of more jobs in energy efficiency-focused industries.</li>
								<li>Making partnerships to increase chances for renewable power sources in
									federally assisted housing</li>
								<li>Increasing the number of megawatts from renewable energy</li>
							</ul>
							<p style="text-align: justify;">The federal tax credit for investment (ITC) is
								without doubt the best solar incentive. The ITC provides 30 percent of the
								amount you spent on the solar installation on federal income taxes. In lieu
								of
								deducting that reduces your taxable income (as is the case with all
								charitable
								contributions you make throughout an entire year) A tax credit directly
								offsets
								the amount you'd otherwise be owed in taxes. Also, instead of being taxed on
								a
								lower amount of income, the federal ITC reduces the amount you owe in taxes.
								It
								may even return to you as a tax refund to the IRS.</p>

								steps:
							</p>
							<ul style="list-style-type: disc; text-align: justify; margin: 10px;">
								<li>Assessing the use of energy in the past for a complete house energy
									assessment, we recommend going through at least the last two years of
									energy consumption. These records provide our team with an idea of the
									timeline we can draw from. We can detect patterns and pinpoint the exact
									location of the time your home had an energy increase.</li>
								<li>Examining the current use of energy Based on these data we will then
									examine your home to find out which areas it could be losing energy. It
									is common for energy to escape through windows, doors, and attics.
									Appliances also can have unique energy draw.</li>

							<h5>How to Save More Energy</h5>
							<p style="text-align: justify;">We've already conducted a lot of research into
								various industries to find
								energy-saving methods. Research continues since it's an inexhaustible
								process. We've already discovered some areas to cut down on your electricity
								and fuel bill.
								These areas are :
							</p>
							<ul style="list-style-type: decimal; text-align: justify; margin: 10px;">
								<li>Very low power factor. Very low power</li>
								<li>Certain motors operate with a lot of variation in load.</li>
								<li>Large-sized motors provide massive starting torque.</li>
								<li>Incapable of controlling the demand for maximum (M.D.) within the
									permitted limit.</li>
								<li>You are not able to use your contact request.</li>
								<li>Extremely high heat loss.</li>
								<li>Controlling your process parameters by using different valves rather
									than altering the speeds of motors. If you are experiencing any of the
									above-mentioned conditions in your company, make the most of this
									opportunity to lower your electricity and fuel costs. If you'd like to
									understand the possibilities of savings, do not be reluctant to call us.
									If you're not certain about the above conditions and would like to
									verify them, our assistance is at your disposal. We offer energy
									conservation that requires very little modification and a comparatively
									low cost.</li>
								<li>Energy conservation that pays little and saving capital is the main goal
									of our company.</li>

									solar panels are usually only offered for a specific period of time, and then
									disappear after a number of solar panels have been installed in your area. Solar
									rebates can lower the cost of your system by 10-20 percent.</p>
