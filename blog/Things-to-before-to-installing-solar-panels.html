                                    If you're a homeowner, you've already considered the advantages of solar
                                    energy. Since it is a costly purchase that you'll need to live with for the
                                    next 25 years, It is essential to conduct a thorough study before making a
                                    decision. Let's look at few essential <b>factors to consider when installing
                                        solar</b>. We are confident that these answers will simplify your solar
                                    journey.

                                <h5>Do you have confidence in your contractor?</h5>
                                <p>Installing a solar energy system is also a home improvement and electrical
                                    project. This is why, when you seek the best contractor, you verify that
                                    they have the right qualifications. For instance, checking if they have
                                    certification from the North American Board of Certified Energy
                                    Practitioners (NABCEP) is an excellent place to begin.
                                </p>
                                <p>If you plan to do something as expensive and complicated as putting solar
                                    panels on your house, you must work with an expert. Conducting research on

                                    work is essential for achieving good results. Even if that means spending
                                    just a bit more than you anticipated but it's worth it. Quality should be
                                    the top priority above all else because solar panels will serve you for
                                    years to come, so it's best to better invest in a reputable service! Stay
                                    away from the first item that pops up in your Google search, and do some
                                    research before you make a decision! Keep browsing to find the <b><u><a

                                <h5>Did you select the least expensive alternatives?</h5>
                                <p>The pricier solar panels sometimes translate into superior solar panels.
                                    While technology has improved substantially in the past decade, putting your
                                    money on the lowest-cost models or brands of solar panels could result in a
                                    dark. The cheapest or lower-end solar panels are usually made in a manner
                                    that renders them less durable. If solar panels fail to last, it reduces the
                                    value of your investment, as with the potential savings you can make in the
                                    future. The worst part is that less durable panels can harm your safety. The
                                    most important thing you want to avoid is for a fire to occur in your home
                                    due to the use of poor-quality solar panels.

                                    correct solar panels. In the long run, it will last longer and yield a
                                    higher return.</p>

                                <p>Warranties are an essential element in safeguarding your solar panels and
                                    related equipment. A warranty can help you hold the manufacturer accountable
                                    without expense if something occurs to your solar panels. Incentives
                                    (available in a variety of states) may require you to have a solar panel
                                    warranty.

                                <p>There are a variety of warranties available for solar panels and equipment,
                                    as well as installation. Certain warranties include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>

                                <p>This kind of warranty will be valid for 25-30 years. If the warranty provided
                                    to you is less than 25 years, you should know that it is considered less
                                    than the industry norm. The warranty guarantees a minimum power output
                                    during the duration of the warranty. The industry standards suggest that you
                                    should get an average of 80 percent energy output over the period the
                                    warranty covers the panels.</p>

                                <p>This warranty covers cases where solar panels and related equipment have been
                                    installed in a way that needs to be corrected. These types of warranties
                                    typically last between 2 and 10 years. They typically include things such as
                                    the parts and labour required to repair or replace components of the system
                                    roof penetrations, shipping replacement of defective parts, and much more.
                                    For more information, be sure to inquire with your contractor about the
                                    warranties they offer for their installation.</p>

                                <p>The type of warranty could vary from one company to another.</p>
                                <p>Some industry standards can assist you in understanding the warranty you are
                                    entitled to. The standard "string inverters" that handle the power of the
                                    "string" of panels typically come with a warranty of 5-10 years. Generic
                                    "micro-inverters" that attach to the individual panels carry warranties that
                                    range from 20-25 years. Inverter warranties generally cover manufacturing
                                    defects or material and imperfections. Inverter warranties usually do not
                                    cover improper installation or normal wear and wear due to extreme weather
                                    conditions and inadequate maintenance.</p>
                                <h5>Are you insured? Do you have the proper insurance?</h5>
                                <p>Consider the right insurance policy to protect yourself and your home if
                                    damage occurs during installation. When you install solar panels, many
                                    problems can arise, and you only consider them afterward. Moreover, before
                                    work begins, many building codes, rebate requirements, legal regulations and
                                    certificates must be met. Before you begin your project, you should find out
                                    what the state's rules and regulations are.
                                </p>

                                <p>Installing solar panels in your home could cost between $10,000 to $30,000.
                                    Some good news: many cities, states, and <b>solar companies in the

                                    offer rebates for installing solar panels on your roof. Before starting your
                                    project, discuss with your contractor the options they have. If they don't
                                    have a choice, they should be aware of rebates offered by the state or
                                    cities.
                                </p>
                                <p>Overall, the government wants to encourage people to be interested in
                                    investing in solar energy. The Department of Energy offers up to 30% savings
                                    via tax credits and rebates. Your local electricity and utility service
                                    providers could have savings too. </p>

                                    could be wrong if you're not correctly educated in the installation process.
                                    Examples include:
                                </p>

                                    shocks that can harm the person working around you and others. Electrical
                                    work should always be performed by an electrician.</p>
                                <p><b>Leaky Roof:</b> Solar panels require you to make holes in your roof. If
