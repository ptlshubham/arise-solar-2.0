                                <p>The energy cost has been increasing over the years because of the increased
                                    use of energy in industry.</p>
                                <p>In the end, many industries are opting to take advantage of the energy
                                    generated by Solar.</p>
                                <p> Are you considering solarizing your commercial premises but unsure how to
                                    get started?</p>

                                <h5>Insufficient research and understanding of the solar company</h5>
                                <p>As of today,the market is flooded with companies that sell Solar Solutions,
                                    but how do you determine which one is superior?</p>

                                <h6>We provide a three-point checklist that you can use to follow.</h6>
                                <ul class="p-4">
                                    <li>
                                        <p> Find out how long the company has been in the solar industry -
                                            Typically, many companies start in this field; however, only a
                                            handful remain in the long-term and produce the expected quality.
                                            Therefore, examining the company's background is crucial for
                                            selecting the right Solar Partner.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p> Are all related areas, like design and planning, execution and
                                            construction, completed in-house? Another important question you
                                            should ask the company you wish to work with is whether all fields
                                            of Solar solutions are in-house or outsourced. The ability to bring
                                            all the necessary expertise within the company is an advantage for
                                            you.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>Find past projects. Please closely examine the previous projects and
                                            ask questions to the team to learn more about their knowledge of
                                            your solar needs. You don't want a weaker team handling the
                                            execution of your project.</p>

                                <p>The most frequently asked question is what happens when the project is
                                    finished.</p>
                                <p>What happens to the service after sales?</p>
                                <p>What kind of support can I expect?</p>
                                <p>Suppose you're not posing these questions when considering the options for
                                    building your Solar Project. In that case, you are making a major mistake.
                                </p>
                                <p>Support for service and after-sales services is a service that has to receive
                                    a great deal of attention. In addition to installing a top-quality solar
                                    panel, it's also essential to ensure it's in good condition to produce the
                                    power required.</p>
                                <p>It is essential to verify that the solar company provides top-quality
                                    after-sales service. They should be ready to help you after the purchase and
                                    installation. To be as efficient as possible, you should always be aware of
                                    a few things.</p>
                                <p>The solar company has to be ready for this to occur. It is important to
                                    remember that the <a href="https://arisesolarllc.com/about.html">investment
                                        in solar panels </a> is a long-term decision that can last for more than
                                    25 years.</p>
                                <p>Following the installation and purchase, many companies make the mistake of
                                    ignoring customer service support.</p>
                                <p>You find out that the after-sales service is not part of the low-cost
                                    services.</p>
                                <p>Be sure that the company you choose provides top-quality and efficient
                                    after-sales support. They should be available to assist you whenever you
                                    require clarifications or maintenance. It will provide you with the most
                                    important thing you need: peace of mind.</p>

                                <h5>Low Pricing is Not Equal to a Better Products</h5>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img src="../assets/img/blog/solar blogs (3).jpg"
                                        alt=" What happens after solar panel installation">
                                </div>
                                <p>The old saying goes that you get what you pay for. This is true for the
                                    majority of items on the market in which the price is an excellent
                                    indication of quality. But what happens if two products are of equal
                                    quality, and one is priced more than the other? In today's market,
                                    businesses must understand that pricing at a lower price might not always
                                    mean you get the most effective product.
                                </p>
                                <p>The quality of solar panels is not made in the same way. Poorly designed
                                    panels can drastically impact the performance and durability of the solar
                                    system. Who would purchase a high-priced product when another manufacturer
                                    can offer the same quality at significantly less? Some companies believe
                                    they can boost sales by launching cheaper merchandise. Still, this tactic
                                    has proven to be a flop and could even turn off prospective buyers.</p>
                                <p>So the question to be asked is"</p>
                                <p>Do we have to chase prices mindlessly? Or give equal importance to other
                                    aspects too.</p>
                                <p>Do not fall into the trap of low prices and poor quality, as this could be a
                                    common error when working with a solar firm.</p>
                                <p>The problem is that our pricing is higher than the other competitors. But our
                                    company's main focus and mission is to offer solar energy products that meet
                                    high standards by ensuring our quality and assurance during the
                                    manufacturing process for solar panels. We can ensure that our solar panels
                                    can be used in any weather.</p>

                                <h5>Quality Assurance & Workmanship</h5>
                                <p>Indian weather is extremely unpredictable for electrical devices.</p>
                                <p>The initial cost could be costly for solar panels, which isn't a recurring
                                    investment.</p>
                                <p>Because of this, you must make sure that your system continues to function
                                    efficiently for a long period.</p>
                                <p>Most businesses offer ten year of performance guarantee.</p>
                                <p>During this period, the solar panel is exposed to over 100,000 hours of
                                    sunlight, rain, wind, and hail.</p>
                                <p>The panels of poor quality will not stand up to these temperatures for long.
                                </p>
                                <p>One of the most common mistakes businesses make is not checking the quality
                                    and work of the solar partner and giving a huge weightage to the price part.
                                </p>
                                <p>It is important not to overlook one vital factor, which is paying attention
                                    to the smallest details. </p>
                                <p>Do solar companies pay attention to small and more precise details to ensure
                                    that the product you receive is perfect?</p>
                                <p>Here at Arise Solar Solar, we are committed to providing our customers with

                                <h5>Shallow Focus on The Warranty Information</h5>
                                <p>As we discussed in our previous paragraphs, installing a solar Solution for
                                    your company and corporate is a step that you will make for a long time.</p>
                                <p>Thus, paying for the warranty information a prospective solar company offers
                                    is important.</p>
                                <p>A solid product warranty will ensure that your Solar products are safe from
                                    damage, and the company that installs them assures that repairs are
                                    completed promptly.</p>
                                <p><a href="https://arisesolarllc.com/services.html">At Arise Solar </a>, the

                                    questions before investing?</p>
                                <p>Various websites and forums are specifically devoted to solar installations
                                    and maintenance. Utilize these resources to build your knowledge and become
                                    an expert in getting better estimates.</p>
                                <p>Here are some of the questions you should inquire about your solar provider's
                                    services:</p>

                                <h5>What is the duration of time since the company has been operating for?</h5>
                                <p>This question can aid you in selecting a service provider who has experience.
                                    It would help to choose someone knowledgeable about the domain inside and
                                    out.</p>

                                <h5>How many solar systems have you put in place to date?</h5>
                                <p>Years of experience may not necessarily translate into knowledge. A company
                                    that has put in only 10 or 20 systems over five years shows that solar
                                    buyers do not trust them.</p>

                                <h5>Is the company certified by the Clean Energy Council?</h5>
                                <p>The companies with this certification are skilled in installing high-quality
                                    solar panels for customers.</p>

                                <h5>Do you subcontract work to a third party? If yes, how do you ensure the work
                                    is of high quality?</h5>
                                <p>In general, contracts that subcontract work might not be able to deliver
                                    quality work because of an indirect method. This is to cut down on time and
                                    cost on the part of the contract. However, some firms make sure that all
                                    quality-check procedures have been implemented.</p>

                                <h5>Cost may not always be the best option.</h5>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img src="../assets/img/blog/solar blogs (5).jpg"
                                        alt=" What happens after solar panel installation">
                                </div>
                                <p>Some companies put on their brand name and increase the prices of their
                                    products. This can be seen in the solar industry too. However, this isn't
                                    the case if you think that expensive products are always superior. Yes, in
                                    most instances, lower-cost products aren't of the highest quality. However,
                                    this is true for expensive panels.</p>

                                <p>As a consumer, price shouldn't be your sole reason for buying a product.
                                    Before you purchase, there are a few things you must consider:</p>

                                <h6>Solar Panel Material:</h6>
                                <p>If you have the option, consider choosing crystalline silicon material-based
                                    panels. They are used extensively for solar cells. The material has a life
                                    span of 25 years, which is perfect for solar power generation.</p>

                                <h6>Solar Efficiency:</h6>
                                <p>Another aspect to consider when considering Solar is to evaluate its
                                    efficiency. If it has an efficiency greater than 90 percent, it's worth it.
                                </p>

                                <h6>Warranty:</h6>
                                <p>This is not a surprise since the warranty is crucial to your device. A longer
                                    warranty timeframe will guarantee that an established manufacturer makes the
                                    panel. Most solar panels, as described above, are covered by the standard
                                    warranty.</p>

                                <h5>Conclusion</h5>
