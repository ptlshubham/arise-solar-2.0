                                    These are the main advantages of PV systems, but there's a second aspect to
                                    think about. Whether a solar electric roof-mounted system is effective and
                                    efficient depends on its construction and durability. Together, solar panels
                                    and metal roofing can maximize your building's energy efficiency.

                                <p>Installing a solar array onto a roof not in its prime is akin to erecting a
                                    house on a damaged foundation. The home's structural integrity will be
                                    compromised, and it will need to be fixed or replaced. Considering the
                                    switch to solar energy, steel frames and metal roofs make the most sense.
                                    Racks for solar panels are made from a highly durable material that can
                                    withstand wind, snow, and rain. Thus, placing them on a roof specifically
                                    crafted to deal with the same conditions and boasting the same warranty and
                                    lifespan makes sense. Even so, most houses in the US use asphalt roofs with
                                    composite shingles. Unfortunately, this isn't the ideal base for a solar
                                    system, especially if it is installed on a roof older than seven years.
                                    These kinds of roofs could fail before the solar panel racks need replacing.
                                    This would result in additional expense, when you include the costs of a
                                    total roof overhaul or replacement along with the labour associated with
                                    removing and re-installing the solar racks.

                                        alt="Metal roofs are ideal for PV systems.">
                                </div>
                                <p>Here are a few reasons metal roofs are the ideal medium for photovoltaic
                                    systems. They're a better match for warranty. The average life expectancy of
                                    solar panels is usually around 20-25 years. Long-life asphalt shingles could
                                    come with a warranty of up to 20 years or more. however, this warranty is
                                    rife with loopholes and typically excludes things like hurricanes, high
                                    winds or other extreme events of Mother Nature. They also don't typically
                                    cover the cost of labour with replacements or repairs.
                                </p>
                                <p>Furthermore, significant repairs or replacements for shingles might require
                                    removing and re-installing the solar array. As a result, metal roofs are
                                    built to withstand the climate and location of your building, and their
                                    warranties can last for 40 years or longer. Your roof will last longer than
                                    the solar panels, reducing the cost of replacing solar racks and panels over
                                    the life of the roof. Racks can be easily put on the standing seam metal
                                    roof. Often called a concealed fastener roof, <b>standing seam metal
                                        roofing</b>
                                    conceals the fasteners beneath the roofing panels. It is highly compatible
                                    with solar racks, which can be secured directly to the seams using
                                    fasteners. By concealing the seams with rack locks, metal roofs are
                                    protected from leaks or premature wear. Metal roofing is also able to
                                    accommodate laminates. Using adhesive backing, laminates attach thin-film
                                    solar panels to the roof's surface. The power output of these solar panels
                                    is still enough to reduce electricity consumption in warm climates. Some of
                                    these systems use a lighter rack system instead of adhesives, which can be
                                    glued onto the roof. <a

                                    build a green home. Other energy savings. According to energy.gov, heating
                                    and cooling account for over 50 per cent of a household's energy expenses.
                                    Yet, A cool metal roof can cut cooling costs by up to 40 per cent. Cool
                                    roofs employ reflective coatings to reflect UV rays up into the air.
                                    Combined with a metal roof's intrinsic reflective property, homeowners can
                                    enjoy lower solar gain and substantial energy savings. Extreme weather
                                    resistance. Metal roofing can be constructed to withstand the force of
                                    hurricane winds, massive snow, and loads of ice. The unique protective
                                    coatings, such as GALVALUME, make them virtually impervious to UV
                                    radiations, the elements and even specific environmental toxins in the area.
                                    This is why metal roof manufacturers are at ease offering warranties for up
                                    to 40 years. They can aid in green building certification. As mentioned
                                    earlier, installing a cool, metal roof can aid in earning points under the
                                    LEED certification program. This certification acknowledges metal roofing's
                                    environmental advantages. Home Innovation National Green Building Standard

                                    are among the most sustainable products. In addition to being constructed
                                    using post- and pre-consumer materials, they are also 100% recyclable. A
                                    maintained metal roof can last between 50 and 70 years, and this can
                                    contribute to sustainable material life cycle management. Before you go
