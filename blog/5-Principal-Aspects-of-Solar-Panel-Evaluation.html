                                <p>Solar energy systems are primarily accessible when you own your own home, but
                                    renting makes going solar more difficult. Since tenants are typically
                                    responsible for their electricity bills on their own, the savings generated
                                    by solar don't offer their landlord any motivation to purchase these
                                    systems.

                                    costs when installing solar panels.

                                <p>Once you own the home you have envisioned, it will be time to make changes.
                                    You will not only reap savings from lower electric bills every month.

                                    put up for auction later - clearly making solar a wise investment that will
                                    pay dividends for homeowners who have access to grids for utilities</p>

                                <p>Renters needn't worry about it. Community solar programs exist specifically
                                    to make solar accessible to renters. Community solar power allows people to
                                    invest in solar power at a lower price than they would pay for utilities.
                                    Community solar is an alternative to power from utilities.</p>

                                <p>However, If you own your house, keep studying to find out the things to take
                                    into consideration when evaluating solar panels.</p>

                                <p>The majority of solar panels for residential use in the United States are
                                    constructed on rooftops facing toward the south. However, the East and
                                    West-facing arrays are equally effective. North-facing arrays aren't as
                                    effective because they reflect directly from the Equator (where the sun
                                    travels every day).
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    A solar array facing to the south will produce the most kilowatt-hours
                                    (kWhs) because of the direct sunlight exposure. But, you may be able to get
                                    more value from your panels by orienting some or all to the West instead. At
                                    peak times - usually from 5-9pm - when people return from work and school,
                                    some utilities charge Time of Use (TOU) rates. You could save money if you
                                    are facing your solar panels towards the West during the day when the rates
                                    are highest.
                                </p>

                                    Solar panels on your roof can generate sufficient energy if you have enough
                                    space for them.

                                    If solar panels on rooftops aren't a good fit, ground mount systems are
                                    another option. While they do take up larger areas on your property, they
                                    permit you to modify your system in any direction that's most appropriate
                                    for your needs.

                                <p>Solar arrays are built to last for 25+ years. Before you invest in one,
                                    consider whether the condition of the roof is suitable for the weight of
                                    such a system. Home builders who have recently built homes often
                                    overengineer them to be able to handle the additional weight of <a

                                    material. If this is the case with you, chances are that your roof is sturdy
                                    enough to serve as the foundation of your system.

                                    is necessary prior to deciding on solar. The ground mount option could be a
                                    viable option when space permits

                                <p>Solar panels are most effective when they are in direct sunlight. The
                                    efficiency of your solar panels may be limited by chimneys, trees, or other
                                    obstructions. Partial shading scenarios like the one above can be assisted
                                    by microinverters and PV optimizers.</p>
