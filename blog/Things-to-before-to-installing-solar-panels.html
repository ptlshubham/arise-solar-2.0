                                    they have the right qualifications. For instance, checking if they have

                                    Practitioners (NABCEP) is an excellent place to begin.

                                    While technology has improved substantially in the past decade, putting your
                                    money on the lowest-cost models or brands of solar panels could result in a
                                    dark. The cheapest or lower-end solar panels are usually made in a manner
                                    that renders them less durable. If solar panels fail to last, it reduces the
                                    value of your investment, as with the potential savings you can make in the
                                    future. The worst part is that less durable panels can harm your safety. The

                                    related equipment. A warranty can help you hold the manufacturer accountable
                                    without expense if something occurs to your solar panels. Incentives

                                    than the industry norm. The warranty guarantees a minimum power output
                                    during the duration of the warranty. The industry standards suggest that you
                                    should get an average of 80 percent energy output over the period the
                                    warranty covers the panels.</p>

                                    roof penetrations, shipping replacement of defective parts, and much more.

                                    "string" of panels typically come with a warranty of 5-10 years. Generic
                                    "micro-inverters" that attach to the individual panels carry warranties that
                                    range from 20-25 years. Inverter warranties generally cover manufacturing
                                    defects or material and imperfections. Inverter warranties usually do not
                                    cover improper installation or normal wear and wear due to extreme weather
                                    conditions and inadequate maintenance.</p>
                                <h4 class="mb-3">Are you insured? Do you have the proper insurance?</h4>

                                    damage occurs during installation. When you install solar panels, many

                                    certificates must be met. Before you begin your project, you should find out
                                    what the state's rules and regulations are.

                                    offer rebates for installing solar panels on your roof. Before starting your
                                    project, discuss with your contractor the options they have. If they don't
                                    have a choice, they should be aware of rebates offered by the state or
                                    cities.
                                </p>
                                <p>Overall, the government wants to encourage people to be interested in
                                    investing in solar energy. The Department of Energy offers up to 30% savings

                                <h4 class="mb-3">Do you have to DIY?</h4>
                                <p>Solar panel installation should be left to the pros, period. Many things
                                    could be wrong if you're not correctly educated in the installation process.
                                    Examples include:
                                </p>
                                <p>Wiring problems It is an occupation that requires you to deal with electrical
                                    components. If they are not set up correctly, you can create electrical
                                    shocks that can harm the person working around you and others. Electrical
                                    work should always be performed by an electrician.</p>
                                <p><b>Leaky Roof:</b> Solar panels require you to make holes in your roof. If
                                    these
                                    holes aren't constructed or sealed correctly, you could damage your roof and
                                    cause leaks.</p>
                                <p><b>Safety Standards and Code Compliance:</b> Most solar panel warranties call
                                    for
                                    installation by an authorized professional. If you install the equipment
                                    yourself, the warranties are null and void. Damage caused during
                                    installation or a defect with the methods used to make and install the
                                    panels won't be covered.</p>
                                <p>Additionally, permits for building and other applicable rules and regulations
                                    can be hard to adhere to if unfamiliar with these rules and regulations. All
                                    paperwork must be done correctly, or the project may be denied.</p>
                                <h4 class="mb-3">In conclusion</h4>
                                <p>The decision to install solar panels requires careful consideration and a
                                    proactive approach. By thoroughly evaluating your options, selecting a
